## Project Title

**PinPoint ‚Äì From nearby to next-door ‚Äî PinPoint connects you.**

---

## Problem

Small and medium businesses (SMBs) are crucial to local economies but face multiple operational challenges in modern customer engagement:

- Limited digital visibility compared to larger brands.
- Dependence on traditional or costly digital advertising channels.
- Lack of technical expertise for marketing automation.
- Inability to target nearby potential customers in real time.
- Absence of performance analytics and campaign intelligence.

As a result, local stores, cafes, gyms, and service providers struggle to attract nearby consumers and compete effectively in the digital ecosystem.

## üß© Proposed Solution ‚Äî PinPoint

**PinPoint** bridges telecom intelligence, geolocation data, and artificial intelligence to enable **contextual marketing** and **real-time discovery** ‚Äî redefining how local businesses connect with nearby customers.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Core Capabilities

**1Ô∏è‚É£ AI-Powered Campaign Creation**  
Businesses can instantly design personalized campaigns and promotional content using **custom AI templates**, without any marketing expertise.

**2Ô∏è‚É£ Real-Time Geo-Engagement (Powered by Nokia APIs)**  
- Nokia Network-as-Code APIs enable dynamic **geofencing** and **device reachability detection**.  
- Customers receive **instant push notifications** about nearby offers as they enter an active zone.

**3Ô∏è‚É£ Reliable Notification Delivery**  
- If the user is **connected**, offers are sent via **push notifications**.  
- If the user is **offline or unreachable**, Nokia‚Äôs **Device Reachability API** ensures fallback delivery through **SMS**, maintaining consistent engagement even without internet connectivity.

**4Ô∏è‚É£ AI Local Concierge (Google Gemini API)**  
The built-in AI assistant understands natural language queries like:  
> ‚ÄúI have ‚Çπ300 for lunch nearby.‚Äù  
It analyzes the prompt and recommends shops that match the user‚Äôs **budget** and **category**, ranked by proximity and relevance.

---

### Design Optimization ‚Äî User-Centric Geofencing

Traditional geofencing creates boundaries around **each shop**, leading to exponential complexity.  
For example:
> 100 shops √ó 100 users = 10,000 geofence checks.

PinPoint inverts this model to use **user-based geofencing**:
- Each **user** maintains a single geofence around their live location.  
- As the user moves, the system detects all shops within that radius.  
- This reduces complexity to **O(N)** instead of **O(N¬≤)** ‚Äî making it significantly faster, lighter, and more scalable.
